# text on the front page
sits in so called hero or jumbotron area. you set up main settinggs and style of this element via shoestrap menu - jumbotron tab

### hero content is set up via widgets panel

you don't need to look at sidebars and widget areas marked here as well if you are only trying to deal with the hero area.

### sidebars and fotter

but since we here already, take a look at sidebars and footer add some widgets and so on
you change sites looks as wel as functionality by adding widgets to the sidebars, footer and wherever else your theme, or framework allows. 

this is for shoestrap 

![enter image description here][2]

once you through with your explorations go to: site admin panel -> settings -> 

### metadata

and fill in the fields with relevant info each time saving the text to a text file on https://gist.github.com/, 

save the changes youâ€™ve made to the document

![metadata plugin settings][3]

make sure you do this on the main site.

what's your idea in terms of background and overal look of the site? i don't want to waste to much time on this. everyone has diferent taste and that's why i went for minimal white space clear font and neat background sliding effect.

its clean and not as taxing as image based themes.
